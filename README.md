# Shortest-Common-Superstring

 Code has two components:

(a) A basic sequencing simulator

(b) The greedy shortest common superstring(SCS) algorithm

Genome string is taken from test_genome.fa, which is sequenced to form the reads in sample_reads.fa, with genome stats printed to sample_reads_stats.fa using read length, overlap percentage, and depth of genome as parameters. The reads are then run under the SCS algorithm to form the SCS's that can be formed from any given set of reads with minimum overlap required as a parameter.
